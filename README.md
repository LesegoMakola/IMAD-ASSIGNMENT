This will give you the best experience regardless of the device you might be using to access the mobile application.
GitHub and GitHub actions play an important role in the development and maintenance of my mobile application. It helps with tracking changes on the mobile application and to move back to the previous versions if new versions might have been introduced it will be much easier for you as a developer to navigate your way back to the previous version. This makes the app stay organized during the development of the mobile application. Many developers can collaborate on the app codebase, and I can do the same as the developers. This ensures the code quality and for developers to share feedback regarding the mobile application you made. It helps developers to report bugs and suggest enhancements and it ensures that the users feedback is done immediately. GitHub reduces the errors that are done manually. It ensures that updates are released reliably and efficiently. It breaks down tasks into smaller components. It helps developers to network with each other and learn more no matter where they are. It helps with open-source projects. It offers contributions from the broader developer community. It allows projects of any size from small sources up to large sources. The development workflow found in GitHub and GitHub actions can lead to more reliable and efficient software projects.

It provides a platform for developers and other users to engage with each other by sharing codes or seeking assistance when you are struggling with a project you are currently working on at the moment. It promotes knowledge. While using GitHub you do not have stress about your information of application getting lost or if you want to go back to your old versions it makes it easier for users to navigate their way back in case, they might face any challenges based on their new version. It makes it much easier for users to manage their work in one place and it is much easier for you to track all the changes that have been made in an application. It simplifies the process of building software. Using GitHub is not cost effective, which makes it to be much easier for everybody to have the right access to use resources and gain knowledge from it. It helps with access controls to protect sensitive information. It helps in maintaining a clean codebase.

In conclusion my history application will play an increasingly important role based on the sharing of our collective past for future generations. While technology keeps on evolving every day. It helps to democratize access to historical knowledge. Creating a history app will help a lot of people in the future because in the next coming generations technology can take over books.
